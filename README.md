# finalProject

The project is a web application where i can show my skills and improve my skill set by implementing any new skill i learn to the project and update it.
it is not an e-commerce site, it's a way to share my knowledge with other people and maybe find a job in the field.
I used django to build the project , and i used bootstrap to make it mobile-responsive.

**Technologies used:**

Django python web framework,  
HTML/CSS,  
bootstrap,  
javascript,  
sqlite3  

**How does it work?**

Browsing: any user can enter the website and browse my skills and education, and my latest news.  
Feedback and offers: any user can send me a job offer or a feedback note, by completing the simple form in "get in touch" section.  
Subscribe: any user can subscribe to my website so they can receive my latest updates.

**Possible improvements:**

have administrator panel which admins can use it to show data and users statistics.  
have a new section where users can try my personal projects in a live demo  
have a blog section where i can upload blogs.  


**How to launch the application:**  

1. check that you have Python 3  
2. check that you have Django framework installed.  
3. clone the code.  
4. run python manage.py makemigrations  
5. run python manage.py migrate  
6. run python manage.py runserver  
7. in your browser go to http://127.0.0.1:8000/ ( or any link provided by django )  
8. you're good to go
